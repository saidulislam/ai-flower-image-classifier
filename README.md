# ai-flower-image-classifier

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

This was one my class projects. I have included the Jupyter notebook that used. It includes detail steps. To use the command line version, you have to start with training your network (train.py).  Once the trainng completed, you can use predict.py to predict your flower image.

You will need the latest version of Python, PyTorch and Pillow libraries.

Enjoy!
